### What is AutoBot?

- It is a server running on Android that exposes certain Android functionalities through Http API interfaces, providing millisecond-level API response speed.
- Out-of-the-box wireless screen mirroring/real-time control within a local network, key simulation, screen recording, layout analysis, file management, app management, contact management, and more.
- Supports running in adb shell and root shell (can also be integrated into system ROM).

### What functionality APIs have been implemented so far?

- Retrieving system information (model info, hardware info...).
- Screen images (supports jpg, base64, supports real-time output via websocket).
- Touch input (single-finger gestures, multi-finger gestures, supports real-time input via websocket).
- Key input (key simulation, text input, supports Chinese).
- Screen layout (supports XML, JSON).
- File management (upload, query, delete).
- Clipboard management (read and modify).
- App management (install, uninstall, clear data, start/stop, view details).
- Contact management (add, delete, edit, query).
- Screen recording, screen control, music playback, SMS querying, notification monitoring, and more.

### What can it be used for?

- Wireless screen mirroring/real-time control within a local network, key simulation, screen recording, layout analysis, file management, app management, contact management.
- Through languages like NodeJS, Python, Java, C++, etc., simply calling Http API allows for the development of remote screen control, automation testing, automated operations, batch processing, bots, automated replies, and more.

### In what domains can it be applied?

- RPA office automation (get screen layout, screen images, notification monitoring, automated operations, etc.).
- Suitable for automotive domain (projecting phone onto car system, reverse controlling phone apps, making calls, playing music, etc.).
- Cloud phone domain (screen mirroring, control, app management/installation, automation, all-in-one service).
- TV big screen development (remote controller, remote touchscreen, etc.).
- Suitable for tech enthusiasts (file server, remote alarms, etc.).
- Personal use (out-of-the-box wireless screen mirroring/real-time control, file management, app management, contact management).
- Android developers (extract APKs, app analysis, layout analysis...).
<!-- - Group control domain, web scraping (cross-border e-commerce, various platforms) -->
- ...

### Why choose AutoBot?

- Runs at system level, offering greater stability.
- No need for accessibility services, can run in both root and non-root modes.
- No need for complex app permissions.
- Can be system-level integrated (integrate into ROM, only requires automatic service startup on boot).
- Supports Android 7 to Android 13 systems.
- Millisecond-level API response time (directly call system interfaces, fast. Much faster than using **accessibility/adb commands**).

### Why choose it immediately?
